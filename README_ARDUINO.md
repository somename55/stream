# Arduino LED Control Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Arduino control from your website.

## What You Need

1. Arduino board (Uno, Nano, Mega, etc.)
2. LED and 220Î© resistor (or use the built-in LED)
3. USB cable to connect Arduino to your computer
4. Arduino IDE installed on your computer

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Arduino IDE

Download and install from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

### 2. Upload the Arduino Code

1. Open the Arduino IDE
2. Open the file `arduino_led_control.ino`
3. Connect your Arduino to your computer via USB
4. In Arduino IDE:
   - Go to **Tools > Board** and select your Arduino model
   - Go to **Tools > Port** and select the port your Arduino is connected to
     - Windows: Usually `COM3`, `COM4`, etc.
     - Mac: Usually `/dev/cu.usbmodem14101` or similar
     - Linux: Usually `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`
5. Click the **Upload** button (arrow icon)
6. Wait for "Done uploading" message

### 3. Find Your Arduino Port

After uploading, note the port name from step 2.4 above. You'll need this for the next step.

### 4. Configure the Backend Server

1. Open `server.js` in a text editor
2. Find this line (around line 17):
   ```javascript
   const ARDUINO_PORT = '/dev/cu.usbmodem14101'; // CHANGE THIS!
   ```
3. Replace the port with YOUR Arduino's port from step 3
4. Save the file

### 5. Install Node.js Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install Express, SerialPort, and CORS packages.

### 6. Start the Backend Server

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ Server running on http://localhost:3000
ðŸ“¡ Attempting to connect to Arduino...
âœ… Connected to Arduino on [your port]
Arduino says: Arduino LED Control Ready!
```

### 7. Open Your Website

Open `index.html` in your web browser. You should see:
- A green dot with "Connected" status in the Arduino Control section
- The "Toggle LED" button should be enabled (green)

### 8. Test It!

Click the "Toggle LED" button on your website. The LED on your Arduino should turn on/off!

## Wiring (if using external LED)

If you want to use an external LED instead of the built-in one:

```
Arduino Pin 13 â†’ LED Long Leg (Anode/+)
LED Short Leg (Cathode/-) â†’ 220Î© Resistor â†’ GND
```

Or simply use the built-in LED on most Arduino boards (already on pin 13).

## Troubleshooting

### "Arduino not connected" error

1. Check that Arduino is plugged into USB
2. Check that the Arduino IDE can see the port
3. Make sure the port in `server.js` matches your Arduino's port
4. Restart the Node.js server after changing the port

### Server won't start

1. Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Make sure dependencies are installed: `npm install`
3. Check if port 3000 is already in use

### Button is disabled (grayed out)

1. Check that the backend server is running
2. Check browser console (F12) for connection errors
3. Make sure the server URL in `index.html` is correct (http://localhost:3000)

### LED doesn't respond

1. Check Arduino is receiving commands (open Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE)
2. Check wiring if using external LED
3. Try uploading the Arduino sketch again

## How It Works

1. Website button click â†’ JavaScript sends HTTP request to Node.js server
2. Node.js server â†’ Sends serial command ('T') to Arduino via USB
3. Arduino receives command â†’ Toggles LED on/off
4. Arduino sends response back through serial

## API Endpoints

The backend server provides these endpoints:

- `POST /arduino/toggle` - Toggle LED on/off
- `POST /arduino/on` - Turn LED on
- `POST /arduino/off` - Turn LED off
- `GET /arduino/status` - Check if Arduino is connected

## Next Steps

You can extend this to control:
- Multiple LEDs
- Servo motors
- Sensors (and send data back to the website)
- Relays to control high-power devices

Just modify the Arduino code and add more API endpoints to the server!
