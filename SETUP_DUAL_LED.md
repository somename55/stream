# Dual LED Control Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your Arduino with 2 LEDs (red and blue) controlled from the web interface.

## What You Have

- **Red LED** on Pin 13
- **Blue LED** on Pin 12
- Web interface with individual and combined controls

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Upload the Arduino Code

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Open the file **`arduino_dual_led_control.ino`** (NOT the old one!)
3. Connect your Arduino via USB
4. In Arduino IDE:
   - Select your board: Tools > Board > (your Arduino model)
   - Select your port: Tools > Port > (your Arduino port)
5. Click **Upload** button (â†’)
6. Wait for "Done uploading"

### 2. Note Your Arduino Port

After uploading, remember the port from Tools > Port menu:
- **Mac**: `/dev/cu.usbmodem14101` (or similar)
- **Windows**: `COM3`, `COM4`, etc.
- **Linux**: `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyACM0`

### 3. Configure the Server

1. Open `server.js` in a text editor
2. Find line 18:
   ```javascript
   const ARDUINO_PORT = '/dev/cu.usbmodem14101'; // CHANGE THIS!
   ```
3. Change it to YOUR Arduino's port from step 2
4. Save the file

### 4. Install Dependencies

Open terminal in your project folder:
```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ Server running on http://localhost:3000
ðŸ“¡ Attempting to connect to Arduino...
âœ… Connected to Arduino on [your port]
Arduino says: Dual LED Control Ready!
```

### 6. Open the Web Interface

Open `index.html` in your browser. You should see:
- Green "Connected" status
- All buttons enabled

## Available Controls

### Individual LED Control
- **Turn Red ON** - Turns on red LED (pin 13)
- **Turn Red OFF** - Turns off red LED (pin 13)
- **Turn Blue ON** - Turns on blue LED (pin 12)
- **Turn Blue OFF** - Turns off blue LED (pin 12)

### Both LEDs
- **Turn Both ON** - Both LEDs on at the same time
- **Turn Both OFF** - Both LEDs off

### Alternate Mode
- **Start Alternating** - Red and blue alternate every second (like your original code!)
- **Stop Alternating** - Stops the alternating pattern

## Wiring

Your current setup:
```
Arduino Pin 13 â†’ Red LED (+) â†’ Resistor â†’ GND
Arduino Pin 12 â†’ Blue LED (+) â†’ Resistor â†’ GND
```

If using external LEDs (not built-in):
- Use 220Î© resistor for each LED
- Connect long leg (anode/+) to the pin
- Connect short leg (cathode/-) through resistor to GND

## Testing

1. Click "Turn Red ON" â†’ Red LED should turn on
2. Click "Turn Blue ON" â†’ Blue LED should turn on
3. Click "Turn Both OFF" â†’ Both should turn off
4. Click "Start Alternating" â†’ LEDs should alternate like your original code
5. Click "Stop Alternating" â†’ Alternating stops

## Troubleshooting

### Arduino not connected

1. Check USB cable is plugged in
2. Check the port in `server.js` matches your Arduino
3. Close Arduino IDE Serial Monitor (it blocks the port)
4. Restart the Node.js server: Ctrl+C, then `npm start`

### LEDs don't respond

1. Open Arduino IDE Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor)
2. Set baud rate to 9600
3. Type commands manually to test:
   - Type `R1` and press Enter â†’ Red LED should turn on
   - Type `B1` and press Enter â†’ Blue LED should turn on
   - Type `R0` and press Enter â†’ Red LED should turn off

### Server won't start

1. Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Make sure dependencies are installed: `npm install`
3. Check if port 3000 is in use by another program

## API Endpoints

Your server now has these endpoints:

**Individual Control:**
- `POST /arduino/red/on` - Red LED on
- `POST /arduino/red/off` - Red LED off
- `POST /arduino/blue/on` - Blue LED on
- `POST /arduino/blue/off` - Blue LED off

**Combined Control:**
- `POST /arduino/all/on` - Both on
- `POST /arduino/all/off` - Both off

**Alternate Mode:**
- `POST /arduino/alternate/start` - Start alternating
- `POST /arduino/alternate/stop` - Stop alternating

**Status:**
- `GET /arduino/status` - Check connection

## Arduino Serial Commands

The Arduino accepts these commands:
- `R1` - Red LED on
- `R0` - Red LED off
- `B1` - Blue LED on
- `B0` - Blue LED off
- `ALL_ON` - Both on
- `ALL_OFF` - Both off
- `ALTERNATE` - Start alternating mode
- `STOP` - Stop alternating mode

## Next Steps

You can extend this to:
- Add more LEDs on different pins
- Add sensors and send data back to the website
- Control motors, servos, or relays
- Create custom light patterns
